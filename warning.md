Do **not** install the package "qmail".\
It destroys Debian.\
(the package does not seem to exist anymore on Debian 11)

It causes errors on Ubuntu, but Ubuntu itself remains stable.\
(maybe it was because I used `wayland` on Debian)

If you want a stable Linux install you do Linux from scratch and install everything from source and don't use paket managers.
