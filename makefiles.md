A Makefile is a unix tool to compile software projects.

#### Why use makefiles?

Makefiles can detect which source files have changed and need to be recompiled.\
So not every file of the project has to be recompiled every time you make a change in one or two files.

#### installation

```
sudo pacman -S make
```

#### general shape of a makefile

A simple makefile consists of “rules” with the following shape:
```
target … : prerequisites …
        recipe
        …
        …
```

#### makefile for podman containers

```
touch makefile
```

It is important that you **need to use TABs** to indent: (spaces dont work)
```
build:
        podman build . -t mediawiki-1.40.0

run:
        podman run -d -p 8080:80 --name mediawiki-1.40.0-container mediawiki-1.40.0

clean:
        podman rmi -f mediawiki-1.40.0
```

Then you can build your container with `make build`, run it with `make run`, and remove the containers with `make clean`.

#### make

If you just run the command `make` it will execute the first "target" in the file.

#### phony targets

When you have a makefile without strings behind the colons like above, it will work,\
but let's say you have a file called `run` in the directory and you do `make run`.\
That will not work:
```
make: 'run' is up to date.
```

You can put this infront of your build commands and it will work even when theres a file called `run`:
```
.PHONY: run
run:
	gcc -Wall ./src/*.c
	./a.out
```

#### targets

>A target is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program; examples of targets are executable or object files.\
A target can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as ‘clean’ (see Phony Targets).

## syntax

#### @ symbol

Usually all "recipes"/commands will be printed to stdout before executing them.\
Put a `@` infront of a "recipe"/command, so that the command will run but not be displayed on the cli.
