"~" funktioniert nicht, man muss "/home/bf" nutzen

example to back up a folder on a second pc:
```
rsync -aAxv --delete /home/bf/Documents bf@[hostname]:/home/bf
```
or (what I did before I knew you could just use the hostname...):
```
rsync -aAxv --delete /home/bf/Documents bf@[ip-address of the other pc]:/home/bf
```
to get the ip of the second pc type: `hostname -I` on that pc\
(but just using the hostname is way better)

Neues Problem nach Ubuntu-Neuinstallation und Wifi-Chipwechsel:

ssh: connect to host 192.168.*.*** port 22: Connection refused
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
rsync error: unexplained error (code 255) at io.c(235) [sender=3.1.3]

=> LÃ¶sung: Ich musste auf dem Ubuntu-Laptop erst wieder den "openssh-server" installieren.
sudo apt install openssh-server

#### human readable

try the `-h` flag to make it more human readable.\
Should change bytes to MegaBytes at the end.

#### less output

Try `--quiet` flag to produce less output.

### full system full system backup

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rsync#Full_system_backup

clearing your systemd logs
```
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=2d
```
and removing the bullshit file
```
sudo rm -rf /var/log/lastlog
```
should speed up your rsync of `/`

but it still did not work..it finished, but `/home` is empty on the remote side...\
maybe because it was "in use" by me...


#### troubleshooting
The huge "sparse" file `/var/log/lastlog` is a problem when doing an rsync of `/`.\
You might want to exclude that dir as well. Or `/var/log/*` if you dont want to backup your logfiles.\
==> does not work, --exclude of `/var/log/*`, rsync will still want to sync that file...\
excluding `/var/*` also doesnt work\
maybe because rsync already started syncing that file...

I did
```
sudo rm -rf /var/log/lastlog
```
this should not cause issues, it will be recreated after reboot and is a binary file with information about last logins.
