I am trying to build a function that comments the line if it is not commented
or uncomment if it is commented no matter in which column the cursor is.
And at the same time not overwriting any registers.
(for example if you do "dd" that line is saved in a register)

let name = "John"

echo "Hello, " . name
echo "test"

"to save the current line in a variable called "curline":
let curline=getline('.')
echo curline

"to get the first character of a variable:
let firstpart=strpart(curline, 0, 1)
echo firstpart

if firstpart == "\""
  echo "this is a comment"
endif

"a keystroke in normal mode:
normal G
