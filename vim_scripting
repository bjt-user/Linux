To execute a vimscript type :source %

I am trying to build a function that comments the line if it is not commented
or uncomment if it is commented no matter in which column the cursor is.

let name = "John"

echo "Hello, " . name
echo "test"

"to save the current line in a variable called "curline":
let curline=getline('.')
echo curline

"to get the first character of a variable:
let firstpart=strpart(curline, 0, 1)
echo firstpart

if firstpart == "\""
  echo "this is a comment"
endif

"a keystroke in normal mode:
normal G
