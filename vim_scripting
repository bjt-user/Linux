Vim scripts have the .vim ending.
To execute a vimscript type :source %
(or "so %")

I am trying to build a function that comments the line if it is not commented
or uncomment if it is commented no matter in which column the cursor is.
And at the same time not overwriting any registers.
(for example if you do "dd" that line is saved in a register)

To go into insert mode and insert the text "new text" do this:
execute "normal Inew text \<Esc>


let name = "John"

echo "Hello, " . name
echo "test"

let curline=getline('.')
echo curline

let firstpart=strpart(curline, 0, 1)
echo firstpart

normal 0

if firstpart == "\""
  echo "this is a comment"
  "typing "_x deletes one character in vim without putting it in register:
  normal "_x
endif

"a keystroke in normal mode:
normal G
