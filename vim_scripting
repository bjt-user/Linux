Vim scripts have the .vim ending.
To execute a vimscript type :source %
(or "so %")

I am trying to build a function that comments the line if it is not commented
or uncomment if it is commented no matter in which column the cursor is.
And at the same time not overwriting any registers.
(for example if you do "dd" that line is saved in a register)

To go into insert mode and insert the text "new text" do this:
execute "normal Inew text \<Esc>

---------------------------------
simple vimscript:

let name = "John"

echo "Hello, " . name

---------------------------------

"this vim script works: (but to use it effectively you have to use key mapping and put the file in the right folder)

function {commenter} ()
  let curline=getline('.')

  let firstpart=strpart(curline, 0, 1)

  normal 0

  if firstpart == "\""
    "typing "_x deletes one character in vim without putting it in register:
    normal "_x
  else
    execute "normal i\"\<Esc>"
  endif
endfunction
