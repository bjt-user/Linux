Using gitlab on the website itself seems to not work very well.

Adding something opens a new branch on default.
But you can change to master branch after clicking on "commit".

It seems like you have to edit the file not in the "web ide".
You have to do it with the "edit" button from the drop down menu.

How to delete a branch?

Click on "2 branches" link in the main project window.
