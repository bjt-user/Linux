`tmux` allows you to have multiple terminals inside one terminal session.

`tmux` opens a terminal session.\
If you type `exit` inside that terminal session, you close the session again.

`tmux ls` shows the `tmux` terminals that are currently opened.

default `prefix key` is `ctrl + b`\
(you can change that)

`ctrl + b` and then type `"` to split terminal windows horizontically.\
`prefix` and then `%`   splits terminals vertically\
`prefix` and then `arrowkey`    to switch between terminals
