#### monospace fonts

It is important to use a font with a fixed width also called monospaced fonts.\
A monospaced font, also called a fixed-pitch, fixed-width, or non-proportional font, is a font whose letters and characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space.

Monospaced fonts make code more readable and you can scan through the code faster.

Even though computers can now display a wide variety of fonts, the majority of IDEs and software text editors employ a monospaced font as the default typeface. This increases the readability of source code, which is often heavily reliant on distinctions involving individual symbols, and makes differences between letters more unambiguous in situations like password entry boxes where typing mistakes are unacceptable.[2] Monospaced fonts are also used in terminal emulation and for laying out tabulated data in plain text documents.\

#### ligatures

Some fonts have ligatures.

In writing and typography, a ligature occurs where two or more graphemes or letters are joined to form a single glyph.

You have to be very careful when using this kind of fonts.
