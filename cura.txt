sudo apt install cura

By pressing "Ultimaker Cura" button in "all applications" I can start a gui.
Then it asks which printer I have. Creality Ender 3 Pro is not an option.
=> I select "custom printer".
You can give a name and insert the properties of your printer.

=> cura has a nice gui, shows how much filament is needed and the duration of the print
