## general info

```
:h user-commands
```

```
All user defined commands must start with an uppercase letter, to avoid
confusion with builtin commands.  Exceptions are these builtin commands:
        :Next
        :X
They cannot be used for a user defined command.  ":Print" is also an existing
command, but it is deprecated and can be overruled.
