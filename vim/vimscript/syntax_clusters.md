## general info

```
:h syn-cluster
```

You can't seem to highlight syntax clusters.

> A cluster so defined may be referred to in a contains=.., containedin=..,\
nextgroup=.., add=..  or remove=.. list with a "@" prefix.\
You can also use this notation to implicitly declare a cluster before \
specifying its contents.
