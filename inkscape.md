```
sudo dnf install inkscape
```

version 1.2.1

inkscape creates vector graphics opposed to pixel graphics.

#### terminology

what is **fill**

what is **stroke**

hit this when an object is selected:\
<kbd>ctrl + shift + f</kbd>

#### how to draw a line

lines keep disappearing

hit <kbd>b</kbd> \
left click on one spot then left click another spot\
then hit <kbd>enter</kbd>\
then the line is not visible\
hold <kbd>shift</kbd> and click on the black button at the bottom left\
=> now you have a black line that is not invisible

or <kbd>ctrl + shift + f</kbd> and select stroke and fill

but in version 1.2.1 this does not work anymore\
the bezier tool (b) makes rectangles now and not lines...

#### export to png

file -> export png image

you can select what you want to export in the pane\
page will export the whole page, white background is transparent\
drawing will just export the drawing and not the whole page, background is transparent\
if you select an object with the selection tool and use the `selection` pane, just that object will be exported\
the `custom` pane lets you set coordinates which should be exported
