#### installation

```
sudo dnf install inkscape
```

version 1.2.1

inkscape creates vector graphics opposed to pixel graphics.

#### terminology

what is **fill**

what is **stroke**

hit this when an object is selected:\
<kbd>ctrl + shift + f</kbd>

#### how to draw a line

lines keep disappearing

hit <kbd>b</kbd> \
left click on one spot then left click another spot\
then hit <kbd>enter</kbd>\
then the line is not visible\
hold <kbd>shift</kbd> and click on the black button at the bottom left\
=> now you have a black line that is not invisible

or <kbd>ctrl + shift + f</kbd> and select stroke and fill

But how to I make that line **straight**?\
hit <kbd>b</kbd> leftclick on the screen\
and then hold <kbd>ctrl</kbd> while drawing the line to make it straight

#### moving objects

you can select them with the select tool (<kbd>s</kbd>)

then you can move the objects with arrow keys\
(but it is an uneven number of millimeters)\
can you set the ammount of millimeters that a stroke with an arrowkey will move the object?\
preferences -> behaviour -> steps

#### grid

with <kbd>#</kbd> you can switch the grid on and off (or view->page grid)

interface->grids

you can for example switch to `mm` and select the `rectangular grid` pane\
set spacing x to 2.540 and spacing y to 2.540.


#### export to png

file -> export png image

you can select what you want to export in the pane\
page will export the whole page, white background is transparent\
drawing will just export the drawing and not the whole page, background is transparent\
if you select an object with the selection tool and use the `selection` pane, just that object will be exported\
the `custom` pane lets you set coordinates which should be exported
