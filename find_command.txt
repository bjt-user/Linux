to show files that start with "te" and are in the current directory:
find . -name te*

If you use two asterix like this:
find . -name *te*
you need AT LEAST TWO CHARACTERS!!!

find . -iname *na*

-i is for ignoring case


There are problems with this utility though, it shows folders with permission denied...
