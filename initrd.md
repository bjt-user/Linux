> The initial RAM disk (initrd) is an initial root file system that is mounted prior to when the real root file system is available.
In the case of desktop or server Linux systems, the initrd is a transient file system. Its lifetime is short, only serving as a bridge to the real root file system. In embedded systems with no mutable storage, the initrd is the permanent root file system.
