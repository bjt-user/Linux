You can copy files from other hosts via ssh (more exactly sftp (ssh ftp) protocol)

1. file -> site manager -> new site -> make sure you select `ssh file transfer protocol`
2. enter hostname, user, password
3. select your new "site" (other word for host) from the downpointing arrow in the upper left corner


then rightclick a file/folder on the remote site and click `download` and it will be saved in the same position as on the remote site.

when you have downloaded the wrong folder:\
server -> cancel current operation (ctrl + .)
