sudo apt install neovim

Is opened with the command "nvim <file>".

It should be possible to install language servers with coc.

#########################################
#user config file (equivalent of .vimrc)#
#########################################

It is possible to load the content of .vimrc into neovim.
But for the start I will use the standard neovim path for the user config file.

You have to create a nvim-Folder in ~/.config path.
And then create a init.vim file.
~/.config/nvim/init.vim

# HOW TO INSTALL PLUGINS ###################
############################################
(https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

Install "vim-plug"
------------------
curl -fLo ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

You should now have plug.vim in your autoload directory so it will load of on start.

Add a new file for plugins
---------------------------
We will manage our plugins in a separate file.

mkdir ~/.config/nvim/vim-plug

touch ~/.config/nvim/vim-plug/plugins.vim

Add a plugin
------------

Put this into the plugins.vim file:
(it should close brackets automatically)

call plug#begin('~/.config/nvim/autoload/plugged')

    " Auto pairs for '(' '[' '{'
    Plug 'jiangmiao/auto-pairs'

call plug#end()

But before you can use the plugins, you have to source them.

Add the following line to init.vim

source $HOME/.config/nvim/vim-plug/plugins.vim

Now go into nvim with "nvim" command.
:P and press [TAB] key until you are at :PlugStatus.
:PlugStatus

It says that it didn't find auto-pairs. (because we didn't install them)
To install plugins type
:PlugInstall

=> and it works (closes ( [ or { automatically after the cursor)

commands for later usage:
:PlugUpdate to update plugins
:PlugClean to get rid of plugins you dont use anymore (probably those you deleted from the file)
:PlugUpgrade to upgrade vim-plug

--------------------------------------
How to install a bash language server?
--------------------------------------

:CocInstall coc-sh
=> not an editor command...

Put these two lines into ~/.config/neovim/init.vim:

source $HOME/.config/nvim/vim-plug/plugins.vim

Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}

(maybe you can also put this into a file specifically for plugins)

Now do:
:PlugInstall
in your (neo)vim.

Now check plugins with
:PlugStatus
