Gnu debugger for C.

#### installation

```
sudo apt install gdb
```

But there was no man page installed for gdb.

***

#### usage

You **can't** use gdb on C source code directly.\
You have to compile the source code first.\
And you should probably compile it with debugging flags.\
Then you can use gdb on your executable.
