Bought a new SSD.
=> it is not recognized in file browser by Ubuntu and Debian.
(Ubuntu makes a mount sound though)

sudo apt install gparted
(it is a GUI program)
=> it recognizes the SSD
==> device -> create new partition table -> gpt
==> create a new partition in the unallocated space (file system: ext4)
===> Apply all operations

Now the SSD is recognized by the file browser.

But I still can't copy paste files into the SSD because of permission problems.

sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb
=> started at 19:42
=> finished at ?
