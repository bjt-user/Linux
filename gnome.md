#### gnome extensions

```
gnome-extensions list
```
to see all installed gnome extensions

You can install extensions via browser but that seems weird.\
You can also download a `.zip` by selecting `shell version` and `extension version`.
(i think they mean gnome version with "shell version")

https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4099/no-overview/

I just clicked on install browser extension then clicked on install then turned it on and then it downloaded and installed itself.\
For manual download and install you need to know the gnome shell version which you can see in settings -> about.
