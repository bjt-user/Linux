script

When you are done hit `ctrl + d`.

Then there is a file called `typescript`.

But the output is not as nice if you have a colorful PS1.

Exporting `PS1` and setting it to something else does not work, because \
script seems to source `.bashrc`.

And even if I change the `.bashrc` script will still use a different PS1...
