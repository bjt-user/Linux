How to add custom shortcuts in Debian (with gnome)
-------------------------------------

Go to settings -> devices -> keyboard -> scroll down to "custom shortcuts" -> + -> give a name
-> for a self-made python script type the following command:
gnome-terminal -- python3 /home/my_user/somefolder/my_script.py
(this will open a terminal and execute the script when you hit the key you have chosen)
