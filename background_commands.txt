How to run a command in the background
--------------------------------------

Add the ampersand symbol (&) at the end of the command:

command &


Use the jobs utility to display the status of all stopped and background jobs in the current shell session:

jobs -l

or if you don't need the number in front of the job (no idea what it is for) just type:

jobs


To bring a background process to the foreground, use the fg command:

fg

If you have multiple background jobs, include % and the job ID after the command:

fg %1
