#### Useful shortcuts while entering commands in a terminal

*these work in Debian (will probably not work in something like `Putty`)*

Jumping a word back/forward while entering commands in the terminal:\
ctrl + arrowkeys

Go to the beginning of the line:\
ctrl + a

To delete from the cursor position to the end of the line:\
ctrl + k

to delete everything from cursor position to the beginning of the line:\
ctrl + u

to delete one word (space delimited) backwards:\
ctrl + w

to yank the text back you just deleted:\
ctrl + y


***

Opening a terminal that is not part of the GUI:\
ctrl + alt + F3

Going back to GUI:\
ctrl + alt + F2

***

Execute the previous command:

Is helpful if you forgot to type sudo before a command.\
Then just type
```
sudo !!
```
