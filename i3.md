#### test on debian

```
sudo apt install i3
```

reboot to log into i3\
click the gearwheel that appears after clicking the username\
choose `i3`

Then a configuration wizard appears.\
You can choose if you want to use `<alt>` or `<window>` key to manage windows.

You can open a terminal with `<window>+<enter>`.\
`<window>+d` and then type a search word to search for applications (like `firefox` or `sqlitebrowser`)\
The corresponding application has to be in your `$PATH` for this to work.

`window` + `shift` + `q` is the default for closing a window.\

#### config changes

The path for the configfile for i3:
```
cat ~/.config/i3/config
```
It is automatically created after the wizard starts.

I change this
```
# kill focused window
bindsym $mod+Shift+q kill
```
to this
```
bindsym $mod+q kill
```
Now **restart i3**:
`window+shift+r`

there is also:
```
# reload the configuration file
bindsym $mod+Shift+c reload
```

I use vim key to change focus:
```
# change focus
bindsym $mod+h focus left
bindsym $mod+j focus down
bindsym $mod+k focus up
bindsym $mod+l focus right
```
=> error because this is already used (for `split in horizontal orientation`)
so I change that like this:
```
# split in horizontal orientation
bindsym $mod+Shift+h split h
# split in vertical orientation
bindsym $mod+Shift+v split v
```
=> no errors

changing colors:\
paste this at the end of the `config` file:
```
# class                 border  backgr. text    indicator child_border
client.focused          #4c7899 #285577 #ffffff #2e9ef4   #285577
client.focused_inactive #333333 #5f676a #ffffff #484e50   #5f676a
client.unfocused        #333333 #222222 #888888 #292d2e   #222222
client.urgent           #2f343a #900000 #ffffff #900000   #900000
client.placeholder      #000000 #0c0c0c #ffffff #000000   #0c0c0c

client.background       #ffffff
```

important settings:
```
# enter fullscreen mode for the focused container
bindsym $mod+f fullscreen toggle
```
Once you are in fullscreen you can't seem to change to another window, you can only get out of fullscreen with `$mod+f` again.

I dont understand what `split in horizontal/vertical orientation` does.
(doesnt do anything)


todo: follow a tutorial\
todo: try these\
To switch modes, press $mod+e for splith/splitv (it toggles), $mod+s for stacking and $mod+w for tabbed.
(from the docs)

To split a window vertically, press $mod+v before you create the new window. To split it horizontally, press $mod+h.
