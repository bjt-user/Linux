apt info i3
Package: i3
Installed-Size: 20,5 kB
Download-Size: 1.996 B
Depends: i3-wm (= 4.17.1-1)
```

But gnome is just the desktop environment and usually `mutter` is the window manager for Debian/Ubuntu.

#### test on debian

```
sudo apt install i3
```
```
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  dunst i3 i3-wm i3lock i3status libanyevent-i3-perl libanyevent-perl
  libasync-interrupt-perl libcommon-sense-perl libconfuse-common libconfuse2
  libev-perl libev4 libguard-perl libjson-xs-perl libtypes-serialiser-perl
  libxcb-cursor0 libxcb-xrm0 libyajl2 suckless-tools
```

reboot or just log out to log into i3\
click the gearwheel that appears after clicking the username\
choose `i3`

Then a configuration wizard appears.\
You can choose if you want to use `<alt>` or `<window>` key to manage windows.

You can open a terminal with `<window>+<enter>`.\
`<window>+d` and then type a search word to search for applications (like `firefox` or `sqlitebrowser`)\
The corresponding application has to be in your `$PATH` for this to work.

`$mod+s` for stacking and `$mod+w` for tabbed.\
I prefer tabbed.\
=> weird, I tried switching back to "stacking" and it did not work anymore

`window` + `shift` + `q` is the default for closing a window.

I miss a command "to go to the next container/window".

I also keep getting stuck in situations and can't get back to the state I want to have it arranged...

#### config changes

The path for the configfile for i3:
```
cat ~/.config/i3/config
```
It is automatically created after the wizard starts.

I change this
```
# kill focused window
bindsym $mod+Shift+q kill
```
to this
```
bindsym $mod+q kill
```
Now **restart i3**:
`window+shift+r`

there is also:
```
# reload the configuration file
bindsym $mod+Shift+c reload
```

I use vim key to change focus:
```
# change focus
bindsym $mod+h focus left
bindsym $mod+j focus down
bindsym $mod+k focus up
bindsym $mod+l focus right
```
=> error because this is already used (for `split in horizontal orientation`)
so I change that like this:
```
# split in horizontal orientation
bindsym $mod+Shift+h split h
# split in vertical orientation
bindsym $mod+Shift+v split v
```
=> no errors

changing colors:\
paste this at the end of the `config` file:
```
# class                 border  backgr. text    indicator child_border
client.focused          #4c7899 #285577 #ffffff #2e9ef4   #285577
client.focused_inactive #333333 #5f676a #ffffff #484e50   #5f676a
client.unfocused        #333333 #222222 #888888 #292d2e   #222222
client.urgent           #2f343a #900000 #ffffff #900000   #900000
client.placeholder      #000000 #0c0c0c #ffffff #000000   #0c0c0c

client.background       #ffffff
```

important settings:
```
# enter fullscreen mode for the focused container
bindsym $mod+f fullscreen toggle
```
Once you are in fullscreen you can't seem to change to another window, you can only get out of fullscreen with `$mod+f` again.

I dont understand what `split in horizontal/vertical orientation` does.
(doesnt do anything)


todo: follow a tutorial\
todo: try these\
To switch modes, press `$mod+e` for splith/splitv (it toggles)

To split a window vertically, press $mod+v before you create the new window. To split it horizontally, press $mod+h.

#### workspaces

`super + 1` - change to workspace 1
`super + shift + 2` - move window to workspace 2

#### floating

Floating mode is the opposite of tiling mode. The position and size of a window are not managed automatically by i3, but manually by you. Using this mode violates the tiling paradigm but can be useful for some corner cases like "Save as" dialog windows, or toolbar windows (GIMP or similar). Those windows usually set the appropriate hint and are opened in floating mode by default.

You can toggle floating mode for a window by pressing $mod+Shift+Space. By dragging the windowâ€™s titlebar with your mouse you can move the window around. By grabbing the borders and moving them you can resize the window. You can also do that by using the [floating_modifier]. Another way to resize floating windows using the mouse is to right-click on the titlebar and drag.

For resizing floating windows with your keyboard, see the resizing binding mode provided by the i3 default config.

Floating windows are always on top of tiling windows.

#### ubuntu test with debug log

https://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html

=> debugging is not supported on my version

I could compile the most recent version of i3, but I think the window manager i3 is not working for me...
