The path for the configfile for i3:
```
cat ~/.config/i3/config
```
It is automatically created after the wizard starts.

#### test on debian

```
sudo apt install i3
```

reboot to log into i3\
click the gearwheel that appears after clicking the username\
choose `i3`

Then a configuration wizard appears.\
You can choose if you want to use `<alt>` or `<window>` key to manage windows.

You can open a terminal with `<window>+<enter>`.\
`<window>+d` and then type a search word to search for applications (like `firefox` or `sqlitebrowser`)

`window` + `shift` + `q` is the default for closing a window.\
I change that to `window + q` by changing this (in `~/.config/i3/config`):
```
# kill focused window
bindsym $mod+Shift+q kill
```
to this
```
bindsym $mod+q kill
```
