apt info i3
Package: i3
Installed-Size: 20,5 kB
Download-Size: 1.996 B
Depends: i3-wm (= 4.17.1-1)
```

But gnome is just the desktop environment and usually `mutter` is the window manager for Debian/Ubuntu.

#### test on debian

```
sudo apt install i3
```
```
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  dunst i3 i3-wm i3lock i3status libanyevent-i3-perl libanyevent-perl
  libasync-interrupt-perl libcommon-sense-perl libconfuse-common libconfuse2
  libev-perl libev4 libguard-perl libjson-xs-perl libtypes-serialiser-perl
  libxcb-cursor0 libxcb-xrm0 libyajl2 suckless-tools
```

reboot or just log out to log into i3\
click the gearwheel that appears after clicking the username\
choose `i3`

Then a configuration wizard appears.\
You can choose if you want to use `<alt>` or `<window>` key to manage windows.

You can open a terminal with `<window>+<enter>`.\
`<window>+d` and then type a search word to search for applications (like `firefox` or `sqlitebrowser`)\
The corresponding application has to be in your `$PATH` for this to work.

`$mod+s` for stacking and `$mod+w` for tabbed.\
I prefer tabbed.\
=> weird, I tried switching back to "stacking" and it did not work anymore

`window` + `shift` + `q` is the default for closing a window.

I miss a command "to go to the next container/window".

I also keep getting stuck in situations and can't get back to the state I want to have it arranged...

#### keybinding names

with `xev` you can see what name your key has in `xorg`.

for example `.` is `period`.\
`,` is `comma`.

#### config changes

The path for the configfile for i3:
```
cat ~/.config/i3/config
```
It is automatically created after the wizard starts.

I change this
```
# kill focused window
bindsym $mod+Shift+q kill
```
to this
```
bindsym $mod+q kill
```
Now **restart i3**:
`window+shift+r`

there is also:
```
# reload the configuration file
bindsym $mod+Shift+c reload
```

I use vim key to change focus:
```
# change focus
bindsym $mod+h focus left
bindsym $mod+j focus down
bindsym $mod+k focus up
bindsym $mod+l focus right
```
=> error because this is already used (for `split in horizontal orientation`)
so I change that like this:
```
# split in horizontal orientation
bindsym $mod+Shift+h split h
# split in vertical orientation
bindsym $mod+Shift+v split v
```
=> no errors

changing colors:\
paste this at the end of the `config` file:
```
# class                 border  backgr. text    indicator child_border
client.focused          #4c7899 #285577 #ffffff #2e9ef4   #285577
client.focused_inactive #333333 #5f676a #ffffff #484e50   #5f676a
client.unfocused        #333333 #222222 #888888 #292d2e   #222222
client.urgent           #2f343a #900000 #ffffff #900000   #900000
client.placeholder      #000000 #0c0c0c #ffffff #000000   #0c0c0c

client.background       #ffffff
```

important settings:
```
# enter fullscreen mode for the focused container
bindsym $mod+f fullscreen toggle
```
Once you are in fullscreen you can't seem to change to another window, you can only get out of fullscreen with `$mod+f` again.

I dont understand what `split in horizontal/vertical orientation` does.
(doesnt do anything)


todo: follow a tutorial\
todo: try these\
To switch modes, press `$mod+e` for splith/splitv (it toggles)

To split a window vertically, press $mod+v before you create the new window. To split it horizontally, press $mod+h.

#### workspaces

`super + 1` - change to workspace 1\
`super + shift + 2` - move window to workspace 2

adding this to the config is also pretty convenient:
```
# switch between the current and the previously focused one
bindsym $mod+b workspace back_and_forth
bindsym $mod+Shift+b move container to workspace back_and_forth
```

#### floating

Floating mode is the opposite of tiling mode. The position and size of a window are not managed automatically by i3, but manually by you. Using this mode violates the tiling paradigm but can be useful for some corner cases like "Save as" dialog windows, or toolbar windows (GIMP or similar). Those windows usually set the appropriate hint and are opened in floating mode by default.

You can toggle floating mode for a window by pressing $mod+Shift+Space. By dragging the window’s titlebar with your mouse you can move the window around. By grabbing the borders and moving them you can resize the window. You can also do that by using the [floating_modifier]. Another way to resize floating windows using the mouse is to right-click on the titlebar and drag.

For resizing floating windows with your keyboard, see the resizing binding mode provided by the i3 default config.

Floating windows are always on top of tiling windows.

#### status bar
```
i3status
```
will print out the status bar that you see on the bottom of the screen every 5 seconds.

you can configure the statusbar in `/etc/i3status.conf`.\
I uncommented the `order += "ipv6"` with a `#` to get rid of the weird formatted ipv6 in the status bar.\
I also clarified the meaning of some of the parameters that are displayed.\
But there seems to be a lot of room for improvement:\
https://i3wm.org/i3status/manpage.html

```
# i3status configuration file.
# see "man i3status" for documentation.

# It is important that this file is edited as UTF-8.
# The following line should contain a sharp s:
# ß
# If the above line is not correctly displayed, fix your editor first!

general {
        colors = true
        interval = 5
}

#order += "ipv6"
order += "wireless _first_"
order += "ethernet _first_"
order += "battery all"
order += "disk /"
order += "load"
order += "memory"
order += "tztime local"

wireless _first_ {
        format_up = "W: (%quality at %essid) %ip"
        format_down = "W: down"
}

ethernet _first_ {
        format_up = "E: %ip (%speed)"
        format_down = "E: down"
}

battery all {
        format = "%status %percentage %remaining"
}

disk "/" {
        format = "available disk space: %avail"
}

load {
        format = "cpu load: %1min"
}

memory {
        format = "used memory: %used | available memory: %available"
        threshold_degraded = "1G"
        format_degraded = "MEMORY < %available"
}

tztime local {
        format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
}
```

#### ubuntu test with debug log

https://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html

=> debugging is not supported on my version

I could compile the most recent version of i3, but I think the window manager i3 is not working for me...


#### mouse config

TLDR: Use this script I wrote

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

PS4='$LINENO: '

CONFIGFOLDER="${HOME}/.icons/default"
CONFIGFILE="index.theme"
CONFIGFILEPATH=$CONFIGFOLDER/$CONFIGFILE
CURRENT_THEME=$(grep "Inherits" ${CONFIGFILEPATH} | cut -d"=" -f2)

# make sure config folder exists
if test -d ${CONFIGFOLDER}; then
  echo "the config folder exists"
else
  echo "the config folder doesn't exist"
  mkdir -p ${CONFIGFOLDER}
fi

# make sure config file exists
if [ -f "${CONFIGFILEPATH}" ]; then
  echo "${CONFIGFILEPATH} exists."
fi

printf "current theme is %s\n" "$CURRENT_THEME"

echo "available themes:"
ls /usr/share/icons

read -p "choose a theme: " theme

printf "You chose the %s theme.\n" "$theme"


printf "[icon theme]\n" > "${CONFIGFILEPATH}"
printf "Inherits=%s" "$theme" >> "${CONFIGFILEPATH}"

echo "Changed mouse configuration."
echo "Please restart the x-server."
echo "(with this: sudo systemctl restart display-manager)"
```

configure the mouse.\
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Cursor_themes
```
sudo apt install xcursor-themes
```
=> but that doesnt seem to do anything...\
cursor themes seem to be in `/usr/share/icons`

```
mkdir -p ~/.icons/default && touch ~/.icons/default/index.theme
```
write this into the file:
```
[icon theme] 
Inherits=cursor_theme_name
```
I use a theme name from `/usr/share/icons`

`reboot` (or just restart the x-server)

And it worked. But I don't like `oxygen`...


`Adwaita` is my favorite theme.

#### audio volume (i3status)
show changes of audio volume (percentage). (maybe a way to change audio volume without keyboard shortcut)

in `/etc/i3status.conf` add the "volume master" function/section and add it to the order
```
#order += "ipv6"
order += "volume master"
order += "disk /"
order += "load"
order += "memory"
order += "wireless _first_"
order += "ethernet _first_"
order += "battery all"
order += "tztime local"

volume master {
        format = "♪: %volume"
        format_muted = "♪: muted (%volume)"
        device = "default"
        mixer = "Master"
        mixer_idx = 0
}
```

### todo

#### soundsettings and changing volume with keyboard shortcuts

you need to be able to change the volume of different devices fast, like headset input and output.

maybe use `pavucontrol` for this.

#### notifications

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_notifications

gnome seems to use this:
```
$ sudo apt list notification-daemon
Listing... Done
notification-daemon/unstable,now 3.20.0-4+b1 amd64 [installed,automatic]
```
```
$ ps -ef | grep -i "notification"
bf          2245    1794  0 Feb11 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/gjs /usr/share/gnome-shell/org.gnome.Shell.Notifications
bf          2291    1794  0 Feb11 ?        00:00:00 /usr/libexec/gsd-print-notifications
```

```
sudo dnf install dunst
```
```
sudo dnf install libnotify
``` 
(was already installed)

and a `notify-send "hi"` already worked because you can see with `ps` that dunst is already running.\
It is not run with `systemd` or a script in `/etc/init.d`.\
So I don't know how it is started, but `/usr/bin/dunst` is started automatically when you log in.


#### lockscreen keyboard shortcut

config file says:\
Use
```
loginctl lock-session
```
to lock your screen.

#### screen tearing in firefox

needs to fixed to make i3 usable in the long run
