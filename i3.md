#### test on debian

```
sudo apt install i3
```

reboot to log into i3\
click the gearwheel that appears after clicking the username\
choose `i3`

Then a configuration wizard appears.\
You can choose if you want to use `<alt>` or `<window>` key to manage windows.

You can open a terminal with `<window>+<enter>`.\
`<window>+d` and then type a search word to search for applications (like `firefox` or `sqlitebrowser`)\
The corresponding application has to be in your `$PATH` for this to work.

`window` + `shift` + `q` is the default for closing a window.\

#### config changes

The path for the configfile for i3:
```
cat ~/.config/i3/config
```
It is automatically created after the wizard starts.

I change this
```
# kill focused window
bindsym $mod+Shift+q kill
```
to this
```
bindsym $mod+q kill
```
Now **restart i3**:
`window+shift+r`

I use vim key to change focus:
```
# change focus
bindsym $mod+h focus left
bindsym $mod+j focus down
bindsym $mod+k focus up
bindsym $mod+l focus right
```
=> error because this is already used (for `split in horizontal orientation`)
so I change that like this:
```
# split in horizontal orientation
bindsym $mod+Shift+h split h
# split in vertical orientation
bindsym $mod+Shift+v split v
```
=> no errors
