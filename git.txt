How to push to gitlab
---------------------
git push --repo https://gitlab.com/bjt-user1/Linux

then you will be asked for username and password

How to push without entering username and password?
git config --global user.name myusername?
=> nope, doesnt work

Try this command:
git config --global credential.helper store

then
git push

Enter credentials again and it might remember the credentials?!
=> worked like a charm!
But where are the credentials stored?

Pulling
-------

Once you have cloned the repository you can't clone again to update the content.
The following command seems to work:

git pull origin
