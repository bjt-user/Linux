The goal is to determine the speed of SD cards.

```
sudo apt install f3
```

first I do
```
watch lsblk
```
then stick in USB-stick with SD-card adapter

so the sd card is mounted in `sdb`

but I don't know the `/media` path.

```
watch ls -la /media/${USER}
```
but the sd-card contains two partitions, so two folders appear
