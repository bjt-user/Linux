The goal is to determine the speed of SD cards.

```
sudo apt install f3
```

first I do
```
watch lsblk
```
then stick in USB-stick with SD-card adapter

so the sd card is mounted in `sdb`

but I don't know the `/media` path.

```
watch ls -la /media/${USER}
```
but the sd-card contains two partitions, so two folders appear

so i will wipe all the data first with `dd`
```
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb
```

```
sudo f3write /media/${USER}
```
the program begins to write endless files.\
thats not what i want.

```
$ f3probe -t /media/${USER}
F3 probe 8.0
