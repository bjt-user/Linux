To initialize a printer you first have to use "CUPS".

Various commands that might help, when printing doesn't work:
lpq       - seems to show the printing schedule of the default printer
lpstat    - shows all printing jobs
cancel yourprinter-14       - cancels a print jobs that is shown in "lpstat" (where "yourprinter-14" is in the first column of a lpstat prompt)
